## Endogenous_Health_Groups
In this repository, I explain the codes for replicating Endogenous Health Groups and Heterogeneous Dynamics of the Elderly, by Amengual, Bueren, and Crego.

The replication material is divided in three blocks:
1. Data preparation: From the HRS to the files to be read by the estimation program.
1. Estimation program.
1. Health classification.
