## Endogenous_Health_Groups
In this repository, I explain the codes for replicating Endogenous Health Groups and Heterogeneous Dynamics of the Elderly, by Amengual, Bueren, and Crego.

The replication material is divided in three blocks:
a) Data preparation: From the HRS to the files to be read by the estimation program.
b) Estimation program
c) Health classification
