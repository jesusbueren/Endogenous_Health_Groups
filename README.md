## Endogenous_Health_Groups
In this repository, I explain the codes for replicating Endogenous Health Groups and Heterogeneous Dynamics of the Elderly, by Amengual, Bueren, and Crego.

The replication material is divided in three blocks:
1. **Data preparation**: from the HRS to the files to be read by the estimation program.
1. **Estimation program**: reads the data from the previous step and estimates the econometric model parameters.
1. **Health classification**: from the econometric model parameter, it classifies individuals into health groups.
